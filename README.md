## Overview
Almost On Board is a web application that provides real-time public transportation departure information from V√§sttrafik. The app allows users to search for specific stop points and view the next three upcoming departures from the chosen platform. This works as a digital real time departure board. A stressed traveller don't need to input the same search multiple times and can access their stop point of choice fast.

- Search for stop points across the V√§sttrafik network
- Select specific platforms at each stop
- View real-time departure information including:
  - Line number and name
  - Direction
  - Transport mode (bus, tram or ferry)
  - Estimated departure time in minutes
  - Cancellation status

## üìö Technologies Used
- Node.js with Express.js for the backend
- JavaScript for the frontend
- V√§sttrafik's Public API for transportation data
- Axios for HTTP requests
- ES modules for code organization

### API Endpoints
The application includes several API endpoints:

`/search` - Search for stop points by text

`/data` - Get departure information for a selected stop point

`/data/:token` - Get departure information using a cached token
